This project is an Arduino-based air quality monitoring system designed to detect smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) gas levels using analog sensors. This system provides an indication of the level of air hazards via an I2C LCD, indicator LED, buzzer, and a PWM-controlled cooling fan based on the detected gas levels.
